pyqueue
=======
A simple python queue implementation ported from my java code.

Includes a simple server that can be tested from telnet, however only the enqueue and dequeue methods are supported.

#API
The API is a piece of cake, just, create a class' instance, and youÂ´ll be able to call de queue, dequeue, size, toList, toString, isEmpty, void, first, last...

#Server
To fire up the server, just type `python server.py 127.0.0.1:1234`. Replace it to what fits your needs

#Server's requirements
gevent.

#BTW...
Do what you want with it ;D
